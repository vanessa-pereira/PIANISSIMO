It is used in the evaluation of Hip and Knee Osteoarthritis. It is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 11 items divided into 2 subscales:
- Pain (3 items): during walking, using stairs, sitting or lying.
- Physical Function (8 items): using stairs, rising from sitting, walking, getting in / out of a car, shopping, putting on socks, getting on / off toilet.

It has 11 items comparing with the original 24 items, where the main outcome is to reduce the redundancy of some dimensions (pain, stiffness and physical function) and the low response rate from the patients, based on study from patients and experts opinions. 
It is used in the evaluation of Hip and Knee Osteoarthritis. It is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 11 items divided into 2 subscales:
- Pain (3 items): during walking, using stairs, sitting or lying.
- Physical Function (8 items): using stairs, rising from sitting, walking, getting in / out of a car, shopping, putting on socks, getting on / off toilet.
The spanish WOMAC short form Index was developed in 2011. (en)">
